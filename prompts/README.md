# Specialty Prompts

A collection of prompts for site analysis using mcp-server-webcrawl. The prompts are cut and paste, and intended to be pasted as raw markdown. If you want to shorcut the site selection (one less query), simply paste the prompt and add "Can you audit [site name or URL]?"

These prompts enable systematic audits of performance, SEO, and website architecture.

I don't know if these belong in the MCP layer or not. I think it may be more important to have the ability to adapt them easilly. For now, at least, they're cut and paste.
