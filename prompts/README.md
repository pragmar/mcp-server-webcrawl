# Specialty Prompts

A collection of prompts for site analysis using mcp-server-webcrawl. These prompts are cut and paste, and used as raw markdown.

If you want to shortcut the site selection (one less query), paste the markdown, and in the same request, type "run pasted for [site name or URL]." It will figure it out.
