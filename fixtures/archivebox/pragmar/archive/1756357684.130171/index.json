In my other videos\n\n2\n00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:15,840\nI've gone over crawler and MCP configuration,\n\n3\n00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,120\nso I thought it was time to go a little bit deeper\n\n4\n00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,400\ninto the practical aspects of the server.\n\n5\n00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,160\nmcp-server-webcrawl is, at a fundamental level,\n\n6\n00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:28,160\na search interface.\n\n7\n00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,360\nYou use it to filter pages and return content\n\n8\n00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,560\nfor review or additional processing.\n\n9\n00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,760\nWhere Google is an all-of-web search interface\n\n10\n00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:41,040\ndesigned for humans, mcp-server-webcrawl is a website\n\n11\n00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,640\nlevel interface designed for AI language models.\n\n12\n00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:48,240\nYou can direct search as much as you want.\n\n13\n00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:51,920\nThe LLM is capable of searching and processing\n\n14\n00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,600\nautonomously. So you can, for example, give it a goal,\n\n15\n00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,000\nand just let it have at it.\n\n16\n00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,960\nIn fact, you can use the server as a custom site search,\n\n17\n00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:07,600\nand it's a good introduction to the server\n\n18\n00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:11,200\nto see it operate with results in full view.\n\n19\n00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:14,800\nSo say I've got this NASA SOHO site crawled,\n\n20\n00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:18,920\nand I'm looking for \"dopplergram\"\n\n21\n00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:23,040\nAnd if I get a noisy results at back,\n\n22\n00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,880\nand I don't want these Joint Observing Plan (JOP) pages\n\n23\n00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:29,440\nwith a little bit of Boolean search I can\n\n24\n00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:32,360\nfill through them out. And I can even tell Claude,\n\n25\n00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:35,280\nlook, I don't know the actual Boolean,\n\n26\n00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:39,200\nbut just get as close as you can to this.\n\n27\n00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:43,120\nAnd I haven't had bad results doing that.\n\n28\n00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:46,320\nLike, Claude is actually pretty good at Boolean queries.\n\n29\n00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:49,520\nIn this case, I'm searching \"dopplergram\"\n\n30\n00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:52,760\nCram, but I mean, you might be searching a product skew,\n\n31\n00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:56,000\nor someone's name, or a JavaScript\n\n32\n00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:59,200\npreference, because it's not just all about the HTML pages.\n\n33\n00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:02,400\nThere's a world of CSS,\n\n34\n00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,440\nJavaScript, you name it as just as valuable\n\n35\n00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:08,480\nto some of you out there as the HTML itself.\n\n36\n00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:12,000\nAnd of course, you see these search results as snippets,\n\n37\n00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,520\nbut snippets is just one perspective on the\n\n38\n00:02:15,521 --> 00:02:19,800\ncontent. You can alternatively retrieve results\n\n39\n00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:24,080\nas raw HTTP content, or page mark down,\n\n40\n00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,000\nor the latest features you can even zero in on XPath.\n\n41\n00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:32,880\nSo you can collect just what you need,\n\n42\n00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:37,000\nand really just manage that token load.\n\n43\n00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:41,120\nOften you don't need the HTTP body at all.\n\n44\n00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,160\nmcp-server-webcrawl encourages efficient token usage.\n\n45\n00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,920\nYou can control the context window\n\n46\n00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080\nby allowing the query results to be as light\n\n47\n00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:52,080\nor as dense as you need.\n\n48\n00:02:52,081 --> 00:03:00,320\nI can find the largest images, CSS, or JavaScript.\n\n49\n00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,680\nLikewise, I could target 404 errors using HTTP status,\n\n50\n00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:17,440\nor a particular character set using headers.\n\n51\n00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,760\nOr mix and match field level and full text search.\n\n52\n00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:24,080\nThe Boolean search foundation of mcp-server-webcrawl\n\n53\n00:03:24,081 --> 00:03:27,120\nis solid. So you can search crawls with high precision,\n\n54\n00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:30,160\nand you've seen the snippets\n\n55\n00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:32,760\npresent in clear view. But in most cases,\n\n56\n00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:35,360\nsearch results are processed in the background.\n\n57\n00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,240\nYou might expand the MCP interaction to verify\n\n58\n00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:41,920\na search query or the results return,\n\n59\n00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:45,320\nbut if the AI is searching predictably and it's giving you\n\n60\n00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:48,720\nwhat you need, this isn't necessary.\n\n61\n00:03:48,721 --> 00:04:01,460\nSo the server provides both search and content retrieval,\n\n62\n00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:11,200\nalong with these content extras to\n\n63\n00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:15,240\ngive a lot of degrees of freedom to get what you're after.\n\n64\n00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:19,280\nYou can embed these crawl queries in complex\n\n65\n00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,640\nprompts. You can write these yourself,\n\n66\n00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,000\nor if you just want to get your feet wet,\n\n67\n00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:27,560\nthere are examples that I wrote in the GitHub repo.\n\n68\n00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:31,120\nSo like the site selection, all the interaction\n\n69\n00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:35,200\nbecomes guided. It's an efficient way to script a test\n\n70\n00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:39,280\nor report, because the queries in the\n\n71\n00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:44,360\nlogic can be expressed in broad strokes\n\n72\n00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:49,440\nusing plain language. If you haven't checked these prompts\n\n73\n00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:53,160\nout, there worth a look. I develop InterroBot crawler.\n\n74\n00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:56,880\nI wrote a plug-in system in a series of plugins.\n\n75\n00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:00,960\nDon't get me wrong. The InterroBot core plugins are more\n\n76\n00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:05,040\nadvanced, more deterministic, and the UI is a\n\n77\n00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:09,120\nlot more polished than these prompts, but they took\n\n78\n00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:13,200\nso much longer to write. Like two, three months\n\n79\n00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:16,760\nfor the InterroBot plugins compared to like a couple\n\n80\n00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:20,320\nof days for the prompts. And the prompts get you\n\n81\n00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:25,720\n80% there. The LLM can be glitchy on occasion,\n\n82\n00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:31,120\nand presentation is chat. It's nothing\n\n83\n00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:34,000\nnot right home about, but the fact that it can do\n\n84\n00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,800\na reasonable job of reviewing any number of\n\n85\n00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:42,860\nwebsite issue classes is notable.\n\n86\n00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:49,920\nWhat is that last 20% worth? Does it outweigh the\n\n87\n00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:53,640\nconvenience of a direct API? I'm still trying to figure\n\n88\n00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:57,360\nthat out. But let me know what you think in the\n\n89\n00:05:57,361 --> 00:06:01,720\ncomments. mcp-server-webcrawl is a search tool\n\n90\n00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:06,080\nfor web data integrates with your LLM.\n\n91\n00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:18,560\nIt's all I have for you today.

At this point, if you want, you\ncan just check and see if it's\n\n94\n00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:40,920\n\n \n\n95\n00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,750\n\nthere.

And it is.\nUm, so we've got our server and we've\n\n98\n00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239\nUm, so we've got our server and we've\n \n\n99\n00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,190\nUm, so we've got our server and we've\ngot our crawls. It's time to work with\n\n100\n00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,200\ngot our crawls. It's time to work with\n \n\n101\n00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,710\ngot our crawls. It's time to work with\nClaude. If we come over to Claude,\n\n102\n00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720\nClaude. If we come over to Claude,\n \n\n103\n00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,470\nClaude. If we come over to Claude,\nyou'll notice that there there isn't a\n\n104\n00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480\nyou'll notice that there there isn't a\n \n\n105\n00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,509\nyou'll notice that there there isn't a\nhammer button here. And uh it's just\n\n106\n00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519\nhammer button here. And uh it's just\n \n\n107\n00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,550\nhammer button here. And uh it's just\nthese two buttons. This is like\n\n108\n00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:01,560\nthese two buttons. This is like\n \n\n109\n00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,790\nthese two buttons. This is like\nuploads. This is\n\n110\n00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:03,800\nuploads. This is\n \n\n111\n00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,229\nuploads. This is\noptions. There is no hammer. And the\n\n112\n00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239\noptions. There is no hammer. And the\n \n\n113\n00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,030\noptions. There is no hammer. And the\nreason is you need to go up\n\n114\n00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,040\n\n \n\n115\n00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,149\n\nhere and you need to edit your\n\n116\n00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:17,159\n\n \n\n117\n00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:20,070\n\nconfig. So if we look back at our MCP\n\n118\n00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080\nconfig. So if we look back at our MCP\n \n\n119\n00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,990\nconfig. So if we look back at our MCP\nwebsite, we already have a site one\n\n120\n00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000\nwebsite, we already have a site one\n \n\n121\n00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,309\nwebsite, we already have a site one\noption here and this is the config that\n\n122\n00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319\noption here and this is the config that\n \n\n123\n00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,470\noption here and this is the config that\nwe're going to use, but we're going to\n\n124\n00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480\nwe're going to use, but we're going to\n \n\n125\n00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:43,589\nwe're going to use, but we're going to\nhave to modify this path right here.\n\n126\n00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599\n\n \n\n127\n00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,229\n\nYou can see that I've modified the path\n\n128\n00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239\nYou can see that I've modified the path\n \n\n129\n00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,630\nYou can see that I've modified the path\nto reflect where site one is dropping\n\n130\n00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640\nto reflect where site one is dropping\n \n\n131\n00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,949\nto reflect where site one is dropping\nthe uh\n\n132\n00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:51,959\n\n \n\n133\n00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,309\n\narchives.

And then when we\n\n136\n00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879\nSo let's save this. And then when we\n \n\n137\n00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,509\nSo let's save this. And then when we\ncome back to claude, it's very\n\n138\n00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:02,519\ncome back to claude, it's very\n \n\n139\n00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,949\ncome back to claude, it's very\nimportant.

You're going to need\n\n30\n00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,320\npython.org. You're going to need\n \n\n31\n00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,190\npython.org. You're going to need\nInterabot. I'm going to assume that\n\n32\n00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200\nInterabot. I'm going to assume that\n \n\n33\n00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,830\nInterabot. I'm going to assume that\nyou've installed\n\n34\n00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:44,840\nyou've installed\n \n\n35\n00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,470\nyou've installed\nInterabot. And we'll head over\n\n36\n00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:47,480\nInterabot. And we'll head over\n \n\n37\n00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,229\nInterabot. And we'll head over\nthere. So, this is the screen that you'd\n\n38\n00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239\nthere. So, this is the screen that you'd\n \n\n39\n00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,189\nthere. So, this is the screen that you'd\nsee first time you open Interobot. There\n\n40\n00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199\nsee first time you open Interobot. There\n \n\n41\n00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,350\nsee first time you open Interobot. There\nare no projects yet. I'm just going to\n\n42\n00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360\nare no projects yet. I'm just going to\n \n\n43\n00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,869\nare no projects yet.

If you're not familiar with\n\n52\n00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720\n20 seconds. If you're not familiar with\n \n\n53\n00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,510\n20 seconds. If you're not familiar with\nuh webcwlers, what this is doing is it's\n\n54\n00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520\nuh webcwlers, what this is doing is it's\n \n\n55\n00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,590\nuh webcwlers, what this is doing is it's\ncollecting all the links in the index\n\n56\n00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600\ncollecting all the links in the index\n \n\n57\n00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,390\ncollecting all the links in the index\npage and then uh collecting all of those\n\n58\n00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400\npage and then uh collecting all of those\n \n\n59\n00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,230\npage and then uh collecting all of those\npages and then doing the same thing,\n\n60\n00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240\npages and then doing the same thing,\n \n\n61\n00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,310\npages and then doing the same thing,\nscanning for more links. So yeah, we're\n\n62\n00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,320\nscanning for more links. So yeah, we're\n \n\n63\n00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,950\nscanning for more links. So yeah, we're\ndone.

You'll just have to add\n\n140\n00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840\ninterobot. You'll just have to add\n \n\n141\n00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,309\ninterobot. You'll just have to add\nuh your particular path. And if whether\n\n142\n00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319\nuh your particular path. And if whether\n \n\n143\n00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,110\nuh your particular path. And if whether\nyou're Mac or Windows, you can find that\n\n144\n00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120\nyou're Mac or Windows, you can find that\n \n\n145\n00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,470\nyou're Mac or Windows, you can find that\npath in the options.\n\n146\n00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480\npath in the options.\n \n\n147\n00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,630\npath in the options.\nAnd next thing we got to do is come back\n\n148\n00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,640\nAnd next thing we got to do is come back\n \n\n149\n00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,149\nAnd next thing we got to do is come back\nto claude. It's very\n\n150\n00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:33,159\nto claude. It's very\n \n\n151\n00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,830\nto claude. It's very\nimportant that you exit. If you just\n\n152\n00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840\nimportant that you exit. If you just\n \n\n153\n00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,830\nimportant that you exit. If you just\nclose, I don't think the config actually\n\n154\n00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840\nclose, I don't think the config actually\n \n\n155\n00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,990\nclose, I don't think the config actually\ngets reloaded. I think you have to\n\n156\n00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,000\ngets reloaded. I think you have to\n \n\n157\n00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,990\ngets reloaded. I think you have to\nexit. Okay. So once you reload claude,\n\n158\n00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000\nexit. Okay. So once you reload claude,\n \n\n159\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,670\nexit. Okay. So once you reload claude,\nyou should have this hammer here. And\n\n160\n00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680\nyou should have this hammer here. And\n \n\n161\n00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,270\nyou should have this hammer here. And\nthis is a good sign. This means you have\n\n162\n00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280\nthis is a good sign. This means you have\n \n\n163\n00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,470\nthis is a good sign. This means you have\nyour webcwl search and your webcrawl\n\n164\n00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:49,480\nyour webcwl search and your webcrawl\n \n\n165\n00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,910\nyour webcwl search and your webcrawl\nsites.

Those are the actions that we\njust configured. Uh we configured it\n\n168\n00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599\njust configured. Uh we configured it\n \n\n169\n00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,470\njust configured. Uh we configured it\nwith that one command. Just a heads up,\n\n170\n00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480\nwith that one command. Just a heads up,\n \n\n171\n00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,869\nwith that one command. Just a heads up,\nthe cloud desktop uh interface has\n\n172\n00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879\nthe cloud desktop uh interface has\n \n\n173\n00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,710\nthe cloud desktop uh interface has\nchanged since I recorded the uh demo.\n\n174\n00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720\nchanged since I recorded the uh demo.\n \n\n175\n00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,710\nchanged since I recorded the uh demo.\nAnd MCP servers are now under search and\n\n176\n00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:05,720\nAnd MCP servers are now under search and\n \n\n177\n00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,789\nAnd MCP servers are now under search and\ntools. So like right here, they can be\n\n178\n00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799\ntools. So like right here, they can be\n \n\n179\n00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,190\ntools. So like right here, they can be\ntoggled on and\n\n180\n00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,200\ntoggled on and\n \n\n181\n00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,869\ntoggled on and\noff.

But the button that I'm referring\nto, the hammer button that I'm getting\n\n184\n00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799\nto, the hammer button that I'm getting\n \n\n185\n00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,830\nto, the hammer button that I'm getting\nexcited about perhaps is no longer part\n\n186\n00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840\nexcited about perhaps is no longer part\n \n\n187\n00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,069\nexcited about perhaps is no longer part\nof the interface. So as of May 25, uh\n\n188\n00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079\nof the interface. So as of May 25, uh\n \n\n189\n00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,670\nof the interface. So as of May 25, uh\nthis is how it works. things are in\n\n190\n00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680\nthis is how it works. things are in\n \n\n191\n00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,150\nthis is how it works. things are in\nflux, so it could change again. But, uh,\n\n192\n00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160\nflux, so it could change again. But, uh,\n \n\n193\n00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,270\nflux, so it could change again. But, uh,\njust wanted to give you that heads\n\n194\n00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:28,280\njust wanted to give you that heads\n \n\n195\n00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,469\njust wanted to give you that heads\nup. So, the first thing I'm going to do\n\n196\n00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479\nup. So, the first thing I'm going to do\n \n\n197\n00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:47,390\nup. So, the first thing I'm going to do\nis ask Claude if he can list web\n\n198\n00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:47,400\n\n \n\n199\n00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,990\n\ncrawls. That looks good. Those are my\n\n200\n00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000\ncrawls. That looks good. Those are my\n \n\n201\n00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,430\ncrawls. That looks good. Those are my\ntwo web crawls. So the next thing I want\n\n202\n00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:53,440\ntwo web crawls. So the next thing I want\n \n\n203\n00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,550\ntwo web crawls. So the next thing I want\nto do is let's make a query uh so that\n\n204\n00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560\nto do is let's make a query uh so that\n \n\n205\n00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,230\nto do is let's make a query uh so that\nwe're searching. So there's two actions.\n\n206\n00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240\nwe're searching. So there's two actions.\n \n\n207\n00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,230\nwe're searching. So there's two actions.\nWe just did the list. So let's filter\n\n208\n00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240\nWe just did the list. So let's filter\n \n\n209\n00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,030\nWe just did the list.

So, at this point, I'm going to\n\n66\n00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000\nwork. So, at this point, I'm going to\n \n\n67\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,870\nwork. So, at this point, I'm going to\ninstall MCP server webcrawl. And the uh\n\n68\n00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880\ninstall MCP server webcrawl. And the uh\n \n\n69\n00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,390\ninstall MCP server webcrawl. And the uh\ncommand to do that is pip\n\n70\n00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:25,400\ncommand to do that is pip\n \n\n71\n00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,109\ncommand to do that is pip\ninstall mcp\n\n72\n00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:28,119\ninstall mcp\n \n\n73\n00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:30,030\ninstall mcp\nserver\n\n74\n00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,040\nserver\n \n\n75\n00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,310\nserver\nwebcrow. And I already have it. So it's\n\n76\n00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320\nwebcrow. And I already have it. So it's\n \n\n77\n00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,789\nwebcrow. And I already have it. So it's\ngoing to say requirements satisfied. But\n\n78\n00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799\ngoing to say requirements satisfied. But\n \n\n79\n00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,230\ngoing to say requirements satisfied. But\nfor you presumably it's going to\n\n80\n00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:37,240\nfor you presumably it's going to\n \n\n81\n00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,429\nfor you presumably it's going to\ninstall. That's going to be exactly what\n\n82\n00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439\ninstall. That's going to be exactly what\n \n\n83\n00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,630\ninstall. That's going to be exactly what\nyou need. So we have our runtime. We\n\n84\n00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640\nyou need. So we have our runtime. We\n \n\n85\n00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,350\nyou need. So we have our runtime. We\nhave our MCP server. Uh let's look at\n\n86\n00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,360\nhave our MCP server. Uh let's look at\n \n\n87\n00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,749\nhave our MCP server. Uh let's look at\nKatana. So Katana is over here in\n\n88\n00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759\nKatana. So Katana is over here in\n \n\n89\n00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,550\nKatana. So Katana is over here in\nproject discovery. Katana and GitHub.\n\n90\n00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560\nproject discovery. Katana and GitHub.\n \n\n91\n00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,270\nproject discovery.

You might need to install the Go\n\n98\n00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:02,759\nthere. You might need to install the Go\n \n\n99\n00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,310\nthere. You might need to install the Go\nlanguage if you haven't already. I'm\n\n100\n00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320\nlanguage if you haven't already. I'm\n \n\n101\n00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,749\nlanguage if you haven't already.

But let's quickly\n\n106\n00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160\nyou found this video. But let's quickly\n \n\n107\n00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,630\nyou found this video. But let's quickly\ngo over it. So you install Go download\n\n108\n00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640\ngo over it. So you install Go download\n \n\n109\n00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,390\ngo over it. So you install Go download\nand install.\n\n110\n00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400\nand install.\n \n\n111\n00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,710\nand install.\nIf you want to check that Go is on path,\n\n112\n00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720\nIf you want to check that Go is on path,\n \n\n113\n00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,110\nIf you want to check that Go is on path,\nyou can say Go\n\n114\n00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,120\nyou can say Go\n \n\n115\n00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,229\nyou can say Go\nversion.

There it goes. And I'm not even\n \n\n219\n00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,670\nsecond. There it goes. And I'm not even\ngoing to really look. I'm just going to\n\n220\n00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680\ngoing to really look. I'm just going to\n \n\n221\n00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,310\ngoing to really look. I'm just going to\ngrab another host here. I'm going to\n\n222\n00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320\ngrab another host here. I'm going to\n \n\n223\n00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,270\ngrab another host here. I'm going to\ngrab\n\n224\n00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,280\n\n \n\n225\n00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:54,670\n\nPragmar. We'll take a look after it's\n\n226\n00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:54,680\n\n \n\n227\n00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,590\n\ndone. Okay. And we're done. So, we've\n\n228\n00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600\ndone. Okay. And we're done. So, we've\n \n\n229\n00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,430\ndone. Okay. And we're done. So, we've\ngot two crawls now. And we can verify\n\n230\n00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440\ngot two crawls now. And we can verify\n \n\n231\n00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,629\ngot two crawls now. And we can verify\nthat by heading into the crawls\n\n232\n00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:01,639\nthat by heading into the crawls\n \n\n233\n00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,070\nthat by heading into the crawls\ndirectory. An example will just have one\n\n234\n00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080\ndirectory. An example will just have one\n \n\n235\n00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,950\ndirectory. An example will just have one\nfile. It's the index and Pragmar will\n\n236\n00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960\nfile. It's the index and Pragmar will\n \n\n237\n00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,270\nfile. It's the index and Pragmar will\nhave quite a\n\n238\n00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,280\nhave quite a\n \n\n239\n00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,189\nhave quite a\nfew and that's exactly what we expected.\n\n240\n00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:12,199\nfew and that's exactly what we expected.\n \n\n241\n00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,390\nfew and that's exactly what we expected.\nSo this is all looking very very\n\n242\n00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,400\nSo this is all looking very very\n \n\n243\n00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,350\nSo this is all looking very very\ngood. And the next thing we're going to\n\n244\n00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360\ngood. And the next thing we're going to\n \n\n245\n00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,189\ngood. And the next thing we're going to\ndo is configure cloud so that we can\n\n246\n00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199\ndo is configure cloud so that we can\n \n\n247\n00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,230\ndo is configure cloud so that we can\naccess all this\n\n248\n00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,240\naccess all this\n \n\n249\n00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,070\naccess all this\ndata. So we're coming into claude cold.\n\n250\n00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080\ndata. So we're coming into claude cold.\n \n\n251\n00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,710\ndata. So we're coming into claude cold.\nWe don't have any MCP servers\n\n252\n00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:25,720\nWe don't have any MCP servers\n \n\n253\n00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,749\nWe don't have any MCP servers\nconfigured.

And the way you can tell\nthat is that you'll only have two\n\n256\n00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520\nthat is that you'll only have two\n \n\n257\n00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,749\nthat is that you'll only have two\nbuttons here. You have search and tools\n\n258\n00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:31,759\nbuttons here. You have search and tools\n \n\n259\n00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,230\nbuttons here. You have search and tools\nand uh this uploads button. If we had\n\n260\n00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240\nand uh this uploads button. If we had\n \n\n261\n00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,629\nand uh this uploads button. If we had\nMCP servers, we'd have a button with a\n\n262\n00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639\nMCP servers, we'd have a button with a\n \n\n263\n00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,629\nMCP servers, we'd have a button with a\nhammer on it. And we're going to get\n\n264\n00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639\nhammer on it. And we're going to get\n \n\n265\n00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,629\nhammer on it. And we're going to get\nthere. Believe me, we're going to get\n\n266\n00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639\nthere. Believe me, we're going to get\n \n\n267\n00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,790\nthere. Believe me, we're going to get\nthere. So, uh, let's go to file,\n\n268\n00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:45,800\nthere. So, uh, let's go to file,\n \n\n269\n00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,790\nthere. So, uh, let's go to file,\nsettings, developer, and edit config.\n\n270\n00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800\nsettings, developer, and edit config.\n \n\n271\n00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,629\nsettings, developer, and edit config.\nThis is going to be where we add our MCP\n\n272\n00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:51,639\nThis is going to be where we add our MCP\n \n\n273\n00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,189\nThis is going to be where we add our MCP\nserver. So, I'm going to open with\n\n274\n00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:54,199\nserver. So, I'm going to open with\n \n\n275\n00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,550\nserver. So, I'm going to open with\ncode. So, I'm going to head back to our\n\n276\n00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560\ncode. So, I'm going to head back to our\n \n\n277\n00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,590\ncode. So, I'm going to head back to our\nMCP configuration uh, with our Katana\n\n278\n00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600\nMCP configuration uh, with our Katana\n \n\n279\n00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,830\nMCP configuration uh, with our Katana\ntab, and we're just going to look at\n\n280\n00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840\ntab, and we're just going to look at\n \n\n281\n00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,909\ntab, and we're just going to look at\nthis for a second. So, we're going to\n\n282\n00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919\nthis for a second. So, we're going to\n \n\n283\n00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,309\nthis for a second. So, we're going to\nuse it. Uh, we're going to change the\n\n284\n00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319\nuse it. Uh, we're going to change the\n \n\n285\n00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,350\nuse it. Uh, we're going to change the\ncommand. For Windows, all we need is MCP\n\n286\n00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360\ncommand. For Windows, all we need is MCP\n \n\n287\n00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,150\ncommand. For Windows, all we need is MCP\nserver webcrawl. Uh, for Mac OS, you're\n\n288\n00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160\nserver webcrawl. Uh, for Mac OS, you're\n \n\n289\n00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,870\nserver webcrawl. Uh, for Mac OS, you're\ngoing to need the full path to MCP\n\n290\n00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880\ngoing to need the full path to MCP\n \n\n291\n00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,790\ngoing to need the full path to MCP\nserver\n\n292\n00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:15,800\nserver\n \n\n293\n00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,390\nserver\nwebcrawl.

And for the data source arg,\nI'm going to use this directory right\n\n296\n00:06:22,029 --> 00:06:22,039\nI'm going to use this directory right\n \n\n297\n00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,870\nI'm going to use this directory right\nhere. So, let me assemble\n\n298\n00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:25,880\nhere. So, let me assemble\n \n\n299\n00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,590\nhere. So, let me assemble\nthat. Put that in there. Save it. Now,\n\n300\n00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600\nthat. Put that in there. Save it. Now,\n \n\n301\n00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,670\nthat. Put that in there. Save it. Now,\nwe got to head back to Claude. We got to\n\n302\n00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680\nwe got to head back to Claude. We got to\n \n\n303\n00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,110\nwe got to head back to Claude.

If you just close, it's not going\n\n314\n00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280\nexit. If you just close, it's not going\n \n\n315\n00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,430\nexit. If you just close, it's not going\nto reload the conf. So, make sure you\n\n316\n00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:48,440\nto reload the conf. So, make sure you\n \n\n317\n00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,749\nto reload the conf. So, make sure you\nexit, come\n\n318\n00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:50,759\nexit, come\n \n\n319\n00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,990\nexit, come\nback, and look at\n\n320\n00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,000\nback, and look at\n \n\n321\n00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,749\nback, and look at\nhere. Two MCP tools available. What\n\n322\n00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759\nhere. Two MCP tools available. What\n \n\n323\n00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,670\nhere. Two MCP tools available. What\ncould those be? Just a heads up, the\n\n324\n00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680\ncould those be? Just a heads up, the\n \n\n325\n00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,309\ncould those be? Just a heads up, the\ncloud desktop uh interface has changed\n\n326\n00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319\ncloud desktop uh interface has changed\n \n\n327\n00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,390\ncloud desktop uh interface has changed\nsince I recorded the uh demo. And MCP\n\n328\n00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400\nsince I recorded the uh demo. And MCP\n \n\n329\n00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,189\nsince I recorded the uh demo.

Come\n\n82\n00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880\ndesktop. So, let's get this set up. Come\n \n\n83\n00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,709\ndesktop. So, let's get this set up. Come\nover here. You say uh file settings\n\n84\n00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:03,719\nover here. You say uh file settings\n \n\n85\n00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,469\nover here. You say uh file settings\ndeveloper edit config. And that's going\n\n86\n00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479\ndeveloper edit config. And that's going\n \n\n87\n00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,710\ndeveloper edit config. And that's going\nto select the uh cloud desktop config\n\n88\n00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720\nto select the uh cloud desktop config\n \n\n89\n00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,550\nto select the uh cloud desktop config\nfor\n\n90\n00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:09,560\nfor\n \n\n91\n00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,550\nfor\nyou. I already have that up in my uh VS\n\n92\n00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:13,560\nyou. I already have that up in my uh VS\n \n\n93\n00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,910\nyou. I already have that up in my uh VS\nCode. So, I'm going to come over here.\n\n94\n00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920\nCode. So, I'm going to come over here.\n \n\n95\n00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,110\nCode. So, I'm going to come over here.\nThe command is actually mcp server\n\n96\n00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,120\nThe command is actually mcp server\n \n\n97\n00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,430\nThe command is actually mcp server\nwebcwl args our crawler wget which is\n\n98\n00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440\nwebcwl args our crawler wget which is\n \n\n99\n00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,470\nwebcwl args our crawler wget which is\ncorrect and then our data\n\n100\n00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,480\ncorrect and then our data\n \n\n101\n00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,190\ncorrect and then our data\nsource is this wget folder but this all\n\n102\n00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,200\nsource is this wget folder but this all\n \n\n103\n00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,190\nsource is this wget folder but this all\nlooks\n\n104\n00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,200\nlooks\n \n\n105\n00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,110\nlooks\ngood. So let's reflect on what we've\n\n106\n00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120\ngood. So let's reflect on what we've\n \n\n107\n00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,790\ngood. So let's reflect on what we've\ndone so far. We've uh added our server\n\n108\n00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800\ndone so far. We've uh added our server\n \n\n109\n00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,150\ndone so far. We've uh added our server\nto the cloud config. We have cloud\n\n110\n00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160\nto the cloud config. We have cloud\n \n\n111\n00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,869\nto the cloud config. We have cloud\ndesktop running already. Now we got to\n\n112\n00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879\ndesktop running already. Now we got to\n \n\n113\n00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,150\ndesktop running already. Now we got to\nmake sure that we have everything we\n\n114\n00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160\nmake sure that we have everything we\n \n\n115\n00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,550\nmake sure that we have everything we\nneed to run the MCP server. What you'll\n\n116\n00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560\nneed to run the MCP server. What you'll\n \n\n117\n00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,550\nneed to run the MCP server. What you'll\nneed is Python and you'll need the\n\n118\n00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560\nneed is Python and you'll need the\n \n\n119\n00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,110\nneed is Python and you'll need the\nserver itself. I've already got\n\n120\n00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,120\n\n \n\n121\n00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,229\n\nPython. You install uh using this pip\n\n122\n00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239\nPython. You install uh using this pip\n \n\n123\n00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,070\nPython. You install uh using this pip\ncommand. pip install MCP server\n\n124\n00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,080\ncommand. pip install MCP server\n \n\n125\n00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,670\ncommand. pip install MCP server\nwebcrawl. But for me, everything's\n\n126\n00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680\nwebcrawl. But for me, everything's\n \n\n127\n00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,110\nwebcrawl. But for me, everything's\nalready satisfied. So once you have\n\n128\n00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,120\nalready satisfied. So once you have\n \n\n129\n00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,309\nalready satisfied. So once you have\nthat, we've got our requirements. So,\n\n130\n00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319\nthat, we've got our requirements. So,\n \n\n131\n00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,390\nthat, we've got our requirements. So,\nwe've got Cloud Desktop, we've got\n\n132\n00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400\nwe've got Cloud Desktop, we've got\n \n\n133\n00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,470\nwe've got Cloud Desktop, we've got\nPython, we've got MCP server\n\n134\n00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:13,480\nPython, we've got MCP server\n \n\n135\n00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,390\nPython, we've got MCP server\nwebcwl, and we've got our configuration\n\n136\n00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400\nwebcwl, and we've got our configuration\n \n\n137\n00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,509\nwebcwl, and we've got our configuration\nin place. The problem is that the\n\n138\n00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519\nin place. The problem is that the\n \n\n139\n00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,070\nin place. The problem is that the\nconfiguration is not going to get uh set\n\n140\n00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080\nconfiguration is not going to get uh set\n \n\n141\n00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,390\nconfiguration is not going to get uh set\nup until we restart cloud. That means\n\n142\n00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,400\nup until we restart cloud. That means\n \n\n143\n00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,149\nup until we restart cloud. That means\nexit, not close. If you just close, the\n\n144\n00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159\nexit, not close. If you just close, the\n \n\n145\n00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,710\nexit, not close. If you just close, the\nprocess will continue running in the\n\n146\n00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:31,720\nprocess will continue running in the\n \n\n147\n00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,149\nprocess will continue running in the\nbackground. We got our hammer. We got a\n\n148\n00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159\nbackground. We got our hammer. We got a\n \n\n149\n00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,390\nbackground. We got our hammer. We got a\nnew button here. We've got two MCP tools\n\n150\n00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400\nnew button here. We've got two MCP tools\n \n\n151\n00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,869\nnew button here. We've got two MCP tools\navailable.\n\n152\n00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879\n\n \n\n153\n00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,380\n\nAt this point, we don't have any\n\n154\n00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:42,390\nAt this point, we don't have any\n \n\n155\n00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,710\nAt this point, we don't have any\n[Music]\n\n156\n00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:43,720\n[Music]\n \n\n157\n00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,149\n[Music]\ncrawls. I'm going to be putting my\n\n158\n00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159\ncrawls. I'm going to be putting my\n \n\n159\n00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,869\ncrawls. I'm going to be putting my\ncrawls into this wget folder\n\n160\n00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:49,879\ncrawls into this wget folder\n \n\n161\n00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:59,309\ncrawls into this wget folder\nhere. So, I'll just ask Claude like\n\n162\n00:03:59,309 --> 00:03:59,319\n\n \n\n163\n00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,789\n\nuh if it can list the crawled sites and\n\n164\n00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799\nuh if it can list the crawled sites and\n \n\n165\n00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,550\nuh if it can list the crawled sites and\nthere should be no crawled sites\n\n166\n00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560\nthere should be no crawled sites\n \n\n167\n00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,710\nthere should be no crawled sites\navailable.\n\n168\n00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720\n\n \n\n169\n00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,869\n\nAnd that's\n\n170\n00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:09,879\nAnd that's\n \n\n171\n00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,869\nAnd that's\ngood. We don't have them yet. So, at\n\n172\n00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879\ngood. We don't have them yet. So, at\n \n\n173\n00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,470\ngood. We don't have them yet. So, at\nthis point, we're going to add our\n\n174\n00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480\nthis point, we're going to add our\n \n\n175\n00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,789\nthis point, we're going to add our\ncrawls. And we're going to do that.\n\n176\n00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799\ncrawls. And we're going to do that.\n \n\n177\n00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,349\ncrawls.

So from here, we're going\n\n98\n00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879\nwe have pip. So from here, we're going\n \n\n99\n00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,430\nwe have pip. So from here, we're going\nto install MCP server webcrawl, which is\n\n100\n00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440\nto install MCP server webcrawl, which is\n \n\n101\n00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,670\nto install MCP server webcrawl, which is\nthe uh MCP server.

So, we're good.\nSo, what does this mean? This means that\n\n120\n00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640\nSo, what does this mean? This means that\n \n\n121\n00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,550\nSo, what does this mean? This means that\nour MCP server, the thing that sits\n\n122\n00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560\nour MCP server, the thing that sits\n \n\n123\n00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,670\nour MCP server, the thing that sits\nbetween the web crawl and cloud desktop,\n\n124\n00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680\nbetween the web crawl and cloud desktop,\n \n\n125\n00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,470\nbetween the web crawl and cloud desktop,\nis ready to serve. So, we've got a few\n\n126\n00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480\nis ready to serve. So, we've got a few\n \n\n127\n00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,630\nis ready to serve. So, we've got a few\nmore steps. Uh we're going to need to\n\n128\n00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640\nmore steps. Uh we're going to need to\n \n\n129\n00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,949\nmore steps. Uh we're going to need to\ngather some crawls and then we're going\n\n130\n00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959\ngather some crawls and then we're going\n \n\n131\n00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,830\ngather some crawls and then we're going\nto need to configure cloud desktop to uh\n\n132\n00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840\nto need to configure cloud desktop to uh\n \n\n133\n00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,190\nto need to configure cloud desktop to uh\nsearch and filter these\n\n134\n00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,200\n\n \n\n135\n00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,869\n\ncrawls. So, I'm on Windows. So my\n\n136\n00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879\ncrawls. So, I'm on Windows. So my\n \n\n137\n00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,710\ncrawls. So, I'm on Windows. So my\nversion of wget is actually running on\n\n138\n00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720\nversion of wget is actually running on\n \n\n139\n00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,949\nversion of wget is actually running on\nUbuntu on Windows, but if you're using\n\n140\n00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959\nUbuntu on Windows, but if you're using\n \n\n141\n00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,869\nUbuntu on Windows, but if you're using\nMac OS, you're probably going to install\n\n142\n00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879\nMac OS, you're probably going to install\n \n\n143\n00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,670\nMac OS, you're probably going to install\nWget through Brew if you haven't\n\n144\n00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:14,680\nWget through Brew if you haven't\n \n\n145\n00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,190\nWget through Brew if you haven't\nalready. You can check if Wget is\n\n146\n00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200\nalready. You can check if Wget is\n \n\n147\n00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,910\nalready. You can check if Wget is\navailable with a\n\n148\n00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:18,920\navailable with a\n \n\n149\n00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,430\navailable with a\nuh wget\n\n150\n00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:22,440\nuh wget\n \n\n151\n00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,110\nuh wget\nversion. So at this point, we have all\n\n152\n00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120\nversion. So at this point, we have all\n \n\n153\n00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,470\nversion. So at this point, we have all\nof our software that we're going to\n\n154\n00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480\nof our software that we're going to\n \n\n155\n00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,790\nof our software that we're going to\nneed. We have our server runtime, we\n\n156\n00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:28,800\nneed. We have our server runtime, we\n \n\n157\n00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,990\nneed. We have our server runtime, we\nhave our server, we have Cloud Desktop,\n\n158\n00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,000\nhave our server, we have Cloud Desktop,\n \n\n159\n00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,550\nhave our server, we have Cloud Desktop,\nand we have Wgetit. So, we're just going\n\n160\n00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:34,560\nand we have Wgetit. So, we're just going\n \n\n161\n00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,030\nand we have Wgetit. So, we're just going\nto grab some crawls to work with for the\n\n162\n00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040\nto grab some crawls to work with for the\n \n\n163\n00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,030\nto grab some crawls to work with for the\ndemo. And to do that, I'm going to head\n\n164\n00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040\ndemo. And to do that, I'm going to head\n \n\n165\n00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,390\ndemo. And to do that, I'm going to head\nback to the MCP server webcwl page, head\n\n166\n00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400\nback to the MCP server webcwl page, head\n \n\n167\n00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,430\nback to the MCP server webcwl page, head\ndown to the configuration, select warp,\n\n168\n00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440\ndown to the configuration, select warp,\n \n\n169\n00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,190\ndown to the configuration, select warp,\nand uh you can see that there's a\n\n170\n00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200\nand uh you can see that there's a\n \n\n171\n00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,670\nand uh you can see that there's a\nconfiguration that we're going to add to\n\n172\n00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:48,680\nconfiguration that we're going to add to\n \n\n173\n00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,190\nconfiguration that we're going to add to\nClaude. But before we do that, let's get\n\n174\n00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200\nClaude. But before we do that, let's get\n \n\n175\n00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,990\nClaude. But before we do that, let's get\nsome data.\n\n176\n00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,000\nsome data.\n \n\n177\n00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,710\nsome data.\nSo, let's head back here.\n\n178\n00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720\nSo, let's head back here.\n \n\n179\n00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:13,710\nSo, let's head back here.\nSo we'll grab example and we'll\n\n180\n00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:13,720\n\n \n\n181\n00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,909\n\ngrab. So at this point we have two work\n\n182\n00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919\ngrab. So at this point we have two work\n \n\n183\n00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,949\ngrab. So at this point we have two work\nfiles. They're work.gz which is gzip.\n\n184\n00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959\nfiles. They're work.gz which is gzip.\n \n\n185\n00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,749\nfiles. They're work.gz which is gzip.\nThat's fine. And in Windows terms that\n\n186\n00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759\nThat's fine. And in Windows terms that\n \n\n187\n00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,270\nThat's fine. And in Windows terms that\nis on the desktop. So we can just grab\n\n188\n00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280\nis on the desktop. So we can just grab\n \n\n189\n00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,150\nis on the desktop. So we can just grab\nthat. We'll work with that\n\n190\n00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,160\nthat. We'll work with that\n \n\n191\n00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,070\nthat. We'll work with that\nlater. Okay. So we have our data now.\n\n192\n00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080\nlater. Okay. So we have our data now.\n \n\n193\n00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,550\nlater. Okay. So we have our data now.\nNow we just need to connect it to\n\n194\n00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:33,560\nNow we just need to connect it to\n \n\n195\n00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,629\nNow we just need to connect it to\nclaude. To do that, we're going to take\n\n196\n00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639\nclaude. To do that, we're going to take\n \n\n197\n00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,990\nclaude. To do that, we're going to take\nthis configuration. We're going to\n\n198\n00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000\nthis configuration. We're going to\n \n\n199\n00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,030\nthis configuration. We're going to\nmodify it to our own environment. So for\n\n200\n00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040\nmodify it to our own environment. So for\n \n\n201\n00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,270\nmodify it to our own environment. So for\nme, that means my command will be just\n\n202\n00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280\nme, that means my command will be just\n \n\n203\n00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,830\nme, that means my command will be just\nMCP server webcrawl because it's Windows\n\n204\n00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840\nMCP server webcrawl because it's Windows\n \n\n205\n00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,070\nMCP server webcrawl because it's Windows\nand it's on\n\n206\n00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,080\nand it's on\n \n\n207\n00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,950\nand it's on\npath. And my data source will be that\n\n208\n00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960\npath. And my data source will be that\n \n\n209\n00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,790\npath. And my data source will be that\ndirectory that I showed you on desktop.\n\n210\n00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800\ndirectory that I showed you on desktop.\n \n\n211\n00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,790\ndirectory that I showed you on desktop.\nSo, let's head back to Claude\n\n212\n00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:57,800\nSo, let's head back to Claude\n \n\n213\n00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,550\nSo, let's head back to Claude\nand just want to show you there's no MCP\n\n214\n00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560\nand just want to show you there's no MCP\n \n\n215\n00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,430\nand just want to show you there's no MCP\nservers right now. I'm going to head to\n\n216\n00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:04,440\nservers right now. I'm going to head to\n \n\n217\n00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,830\nservers right now. I'm going to head to\nsettings, developer, edit,\n\n218\n00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840\n\n \n\n219\n00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,550\n\nconfig, and\n\n220\n00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:11,560\nconfig, and\n \n\n221\n00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,670\nconfig, and\nthen I'm going to add my new\n\n222\n00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:14,680\nthen I'm going to add my new\n \n\n223\n00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,909\nthen I'm going to add my new\nconfiguration. Okay, so let's save that.\n\n224\n00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919\nconfiguration. Okay, so let's save that.\n \n\n225\n00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,070\nconfiguration. Okay, so let's save that.\nHead back to Claude. we need to fully\n\n226\n00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,080\nHead back to Claude. we need to fully\n \n\n227\n00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,189\nHead back to Claude. we need to fully\nclose in order to reload the uh\n\n228\n00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:26,199\n\n \n\n229\n00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,029\n\nconfiguration. So when we come back,\n\n230\n00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039\nconfiguration. So when we come back,\n \n\n231\n00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,430\nconfiguration. So when we come back,\nwe'll have our MCP server and they are\n\n232\n00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440\nwe'll have our MCP server and they are\n \n\n233\n00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,230\nwe'll have our MCP server and they are\nboth active. So everything looks good.\n\n234\n00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240\nboth active. So everything looks good.\n \n\n235\n00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,070\nboth active. So everything looks good.\nWe can actually start interacting with\n\n236\n00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080\nWe can actually start interacting with\n \n\n237\n00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,070\nWe can actually start interacting with\nour data. Right now we can ask uh can\n\n238\n00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080\nour data. Right now we can ask uh can\n \n\n239\n00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:46,670\nour data.
