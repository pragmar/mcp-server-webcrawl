# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This project is still finding its footing, and I'm keeping things simple for now.

## The Process

**Start with an issue.** Before writing code, open an issue to discuss the problem being addressed.

This saves everyone time and ensures we're aligned.

## What I'm Looking For

* Bugs with clear reproduction steps
* LLM API hangups that I may be unaware of (fixations, etc. leading to extra queries or misleading results)
* New and exciting prompts utilizing the embedded search method

## Guidelines

* This is evolving as I figure out what works
* No additional package requirements, please
* No new crawlers without viable long-term support (forking is encouraged!)
* Follow existing code style
* Include tests where appropriate
* Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized

I'm currently pushing to master, it's been a solo effort as of writing. If and when higher-level git workflow is required, I'll reorganize the repo into something more community-oriented.

Questions? Open an issue and let's talk.
